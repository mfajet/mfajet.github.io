                <p>This intermediate-level course introduces the mathematical foundations to derive Principal Component
                    Analysis (PCA), a fundamental dimensionality reduction technique. It covers how to use some basic
                    statistics of data sets, such as mean values and variances, compute distances and angles between
                    vectors using inner products and derive orthogonal projections of data onto lower-dimensional
                    subspaces. Using all these tools, the course shows how to then derive PCA as a method that minimizes
                    the average squared reconstruction error between data points and their reconstruction.</p>
